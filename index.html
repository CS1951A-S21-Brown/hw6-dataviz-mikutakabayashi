    <p>1. For the first question I simply took the first 10 records in the dataset, since the dataset was already sorted by Global Sales,
        which is an indicator of how well the games are liked. As seen, Wii Sports was the best-selling game overall, with 82.74 million 
        sales globally. For the second question, there was more open-endedness about how to calculate popularity. I first took the top 100 
        best-selling games of every region (so game titles in the top 100 differ based on region), and then calculated the percent of sales
        that each genre had in this top 100. I felt that this was the best way to calculate popularity because if calculating on the entire
        dataset, there may be more of certain genres than others. But including only the top 100, there may not be some genres included, but 
        that just shows that the genre is not popular in that region. Then, on the map, by scrolling over the countries within that region, 
        we can see the ranking of the top 3 genres and the percentage for each. On the third question, similar to the second, there was an
        open-endedness of calculating best publisher. First, I took apart the dataset and got the top 50 games of each genre (based on global
        sales) and then on a pie chart, depicted how many of the top 50 games were from each publisher. 
    </p>
    <p>2. D3 was very helpful for question 3, where I could create multiple different graphs under one format. This helps because if I were
        to make one single chart showing all the data as I did in the 12 graphs I did for part 3, it would become very confusing and 
        cluttered. Another way that D3 was useful was to be able to make the map that I did for problem 2, with the mouseover and the 
        dynamics that I used for all of the problems that were asked. If this was not an option, I would have used a static bar or pie 
        chart like I did before, but I feel that the map makes it easier to interpret the 
        region (although I wish I could have done no country lines). One other way that D3 was useful was to deal with larger amounts of 
        data and being able to update what is being used in the charts without changing the code. When adjusting for the different ways to 
        calculate popularity, I first just used a format for the second question like I did for the third. However, I wanted to calculate it
        differently, so all I had to do was change what data I pulled from the dataset into the csv, which required no change in the js file 
        or the html file. If the data is to change in the future, this would not be a problem because the file can be accomodating to other
        data.
    </p>
    <p>3. D3 is sometimes not the best way to create a visualization from scratch when the graph or chart is very simple and can be created
        using a different visualization tool, such as Python's matplotlib or Excel. Because we need to format and create every single part of the 
        graph (becauase there aren't any premade templates in d3), it turns into a more time-consuming task. Another reason why D3 may not
        always be the choice of visualization tool is when there are huge amounts of data points to plot. Of course, any tool would struggle
        graphing or plotting all of the points, but even in my graphs or the scatter plot graph in the example, the data points come out 
        slowly when there are many, many points. Therefore, in those kinds of situations, it may be better to use a different tool to plot 
        a graph. Finally, D3 is definitely harder to understand and learn how to manipulate. For each of the graphs, I had to initially 
        take an example and adapt it to my needs based on the data I was using and what functions I wanted the graph to have. However, I 
        definitely would not have been able to do so from scratch. Therefore, without the proper experience and practice, I think it would 
        be better to use an alternative tool in creating graphs that can be done elsewhere. 
    </p>
    <p>4. This dashboard would be accessible to most people; even people with color blindness would be fine using the graph, since the colors
        do not have much meaning other than separating certain pieces of the graph to differentiate. In addition, as the article "A 
        Comprehensive Guide to Accessible Data Visualization", most parts of the graphs and charts are separated by white space, allowing 
        for a clear separation between pieces. I also added a dropdown menu for the selection so that it is easier to click and adjust what 
        genre we want to look at. However, this dashboard would not be very accessible to the blind because there are hover-overs that would
        not be able to see what part of the map the person is on, which is one of the parts that the article mentioned previously advises 
        not to do (this would be hard to avoid on the map though). In order to fix this, it may be better to just add text onto the svg or
        add a description with the data reported underneath, so that the screen reader could easily read off the data without the person 
        going over the map. 
    </p>
    <p>5. As mentioned above, the map could be implemented in a better way to make it less finicky and adding the description underneath, or
        made into bar graphs with the numbers to the side, as done in question 1's graph. However for the extra credit portion and the ease 
        of communicating the region of the world through map, I chose to do what I did. In addition, instead of only having the mouseovers
        on the pie chart, I could have written out the names and rankings of the publishers (on top of the number of games). But this would 
        cause the graph to become heavily crowded for one, and also require me
        to manually change up the dataset more, and the way I implemented this portion would be harder to integrate the rankings, as I did
        key-value pairs on the graph. Also, based on the space, if I had added more, visually, the chart would look more clustered and 
        unorganized, which would be another downfall for other groups of people.
